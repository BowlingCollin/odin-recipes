        <h1>Smoked Sausage Mac & Cheese</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I found the original version of this recipe online, which used shredded chicken. However, I did not have any chicken breasts at the time and decided to instead substitute with some andouille chicken sausage instead. I use Kraft box mac and cheese for this recipe as it saves me time, but you could make your own mac and cheese and use it just as easily if you choose.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 box of Kraft mac & cheese</li>
