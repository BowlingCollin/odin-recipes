        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I discovered this version of the traditional peanut butter and jelly Sandwich
            just a short while ago. My version includes an unusual fourth ingredient which
            is sriracha hot sauce. I had thought of this recipe shortly after reading a reddit
            post about an individual that discovered that the reason he enjoyed the spicyness
            of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich due to his allergy to peanuts. After discovering 
            this allergy he began to use jalapeno jelly and peanut butter substitute, to imitate 
            the feeling created from the allergy. This concept was interesting to me, therefore 
            leading me to begin eating a spicy peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
